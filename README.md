## Hello! My name is Kevin. 👋🏼

Thank you for looking into my Github! My name is Kevin. I am a data analyst seeking to explore the opportunities data can provide for business action. Joining the MS in Business Analytics program at USC Marshall, I am looking forward to sharing what I have learned with you.
