## Hello! My name is KK. 👋🏼

Thank you for looking into my Github! My preferred name is KK (way easier than Chaiyapuk). I am a data analyst coming from Thailand, seeking to explore the opportunities data can provide for business action. Joining the MS in Business Analytics program at USC Marshall, I am looking forward to sharing what I have learned with you.
