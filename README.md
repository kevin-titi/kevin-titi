## Hello! My name is KK. 👋🏼

Thank you for looking into my Github! My preferred name is **KK** (way easier than Chaiyapuk). I am a data analyst coming from Thailand, seeking to explore the opportunities data can provide for business action. Joining the MS in Business Analytics program at USC Marshall, I am looking forward to sharing what I have learned with you.

This Github will be where I put both my personal and professional projects. If you are interested, don't hesitate to reach out to me!

I will graduate in December 2023. Looking for an amazing data analyst? Please contact me at titinana@marshall.usc.edu

## My interest is in gaming industry and people analytics.
